<p>I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her?
    I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see the glow from the lights, he
    thought. I wish too many things. But that is the thing I wish for now. He tried to settle more comfortably to steer
    and from his pain he knew he was not dead.
</p>

<p>He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten o'clock at night. They were
    only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises. Then they were steady to see across the
    ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon,
    he must hit the edge of the stream.
</p>

 <p>Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do against them in the dark without
     a weapon? He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the cold
     of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so much I do not have to fight again.
</p>

<p>But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They came in a pack and he could only see the
    lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed
    at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed desperately at
    what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it was gone.
